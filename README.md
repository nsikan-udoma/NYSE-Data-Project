# Analyzing the NYSE Data for the “Soft Drinks” GCIS Sub Industry to Understand Financial Performance from 2013 to 2015

Analyzing real-life data from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). A subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle was used in this analysis. The dataset contained historical financial data from S&P 500 companies listed on the NYSE between 2013 and 2016 (if available).

Background:
Two (2) datasets Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files were downloaded from Kaggle. The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.
Both datasets were cleaned and combined to one dataset for the purpose of this project.

Tasks to be performed included: calculating summary statistics, drawing inference from the statistics, measuring business metrics, and using financial models to forecast future growth projects for the 448 S&P 500 companies listed in the NYSE.

The cleaned dataset contains the following information:
- Ticker symbol: Stock symbol
- Years: Number of years for which data is provided
- Period ending
- Total revenue
- Cost of goods sold
- Sales, General, and Administrative expenses
- Research and Development expenses
- Other Operating expense items
- Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Sector: The industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., American Airlines with the ticker symbol AAL is categorized under Industrials.)
- GICS Sub Industry: Sub-industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., AAL is further categorized under the sub-category of the "Airlines" industry.)

Skills to be Demonstrated:
The main goal of the project is to showcase my ability to:
- Interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range).
- Use a combination of Excel functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX, and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, dropdowns, data validation, VLOOKUP).
- Develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement (Income Statement), that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list of all companies. The P&L statement should include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.
- Create a dynamic financial model for one (1) company at a time, that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case, and Base case). Forecasting assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin should change for each scenario. The forecasting model should be dynamic for the selection of the case (Weak, Base, Strong). However, the forecasting model can be static for the chosen company sticker symbol.

Presentation of Insights:
At the end of the analysis, a separate powerpoint presentation was created to showcase findings from the data analysis performed.
